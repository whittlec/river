# River Levels

A simple app to show the river levels at York City Rowing Club.

It shows observed and forecast data of the [River Ouse level at Viking Recorder](https://check-for-flooding.service.gov.uk/station/8208).

It aims to act as an indicator as to whether it might be expected to be able to
row.

## TODO

- Determine the correct maximum safe rowing height (currently displays 1.9m as
  safe)
