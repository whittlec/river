# River Levels

A simple app to show the river levels at York City Rowing Club.

It shows observed and forecast data of the [River Ouse level at Viking Recorder](https://check-for-flooding.service.gov.uk/station/8208).

It aims to act as an indicator as to whether it might be expected to be able to
row.

## Disclaimer

This app cannot safely be used to accurately decide whether or not it is truly
safe to row on the river. Users should exercise caution and always adhere to the
rules of their rowing club.

## TODO

- Determine the correct maximum safe rowing height (currently displays 1.9m as
  safe)
